### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2019

+ Projec title: Happy Data
+ This project is conducted by Xishi Chen (UNI:xc2455)

+ Project summary: In the project, I analysed HappyDB with LDA model, then divided data into different topics and found some information. Finally I got some reasons for happiness:

Watching movies/ TV shows as entertainment
Having fun and spending time with family
Finishing everyday work and going back to home
Doing things for the first time and learning new things
having delicious food in dinners or lunches
Passing an interview and getting a new job
